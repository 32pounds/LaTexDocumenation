\textbf{Madeleine Brennan, Elizabeth Hernandez}

\textbf{Diagram:}

\textbf{Description:}

Bueracracy deals with interactions between entities in the game, with the biggest interaction within this catagory being quests. The diagram above visually shows the classes that are related to receiving and completing quests. This relates to bueracracy because completing quests will help achieve higher approval ratings with the faction that hosts the quest.

The root class is titled "Entity" and defines basic features of all characters in the game.
The classes "NPC" and "PC", which stand for "non-player character" and "player character" respectively, are extensions of the Entity class. 
Each PC will track the state of their quests in a Quest Log. 
The Quest Log will consist of 0 to many quests.
Each Quest consists of 1 to many quest Stages.
Stages hold requirements and rewards for each step of progression in its parent Quest.
Each Stage is held by an NPC.
A PC must engage in Dialog with an NPC in order to gain and advance through Stages of their Quests.
